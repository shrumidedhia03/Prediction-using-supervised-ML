## Prediction-using-supervised-ML
In this project, I have explored the relationship between the number of study hours and the percentage of a student. Using supervised machine learning techniques, I have built a regression model to predict a student's percentage based on the number of study hours.

##Project Overview
The project is divided into several key components:

Importing Important Libraries: We start by importing the necessary Python libraries required for data analysis and modeling.

Loading the Data: The dataset containing information about the number of study hours and the corresponding percentage of students is loaded for analysis.

Data Visualization: Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the data using various data visualization techniques.

Regression Model: A regression model is built using supervised machine learning to predict a student's percentage based on study hours.

Prediction: We make predictions using the trained model, including an example prediction for a student who studies 9.25 hours a day.

Performance Evaluation: The performance of the regression model is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

##Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.x installed
Jupyter Notebook or an equivalent IDE installed
Required libraries installed (specified in the project files)

##Installation
To get started, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

##Data
The dataset used for this project contains two columns: "Hours" and "Percentage." The "Hours" column represents the number of study hours, and the "Percentage" column represents the corresponding student's percentage.

##Data Visualization
Exploratory data analysis is performed to visualize the relationship between study hours and percentages. Various plots and visualizations are created to gain insights into the data.

##Regression Model
A regression model is built using supervised machine learning techniques. This model is trained to predict a student's percentage based on the number of study hours.

##Prediction
We use the trained regression model to make predictions. Specifically, we predict the score of a student who studies 9.25 hours per day.

##Performance Evaluation
The performance of the regression model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to determine its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting student percentages.
